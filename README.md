Solar Cooling Annual Simulation (Matlab Code)
This code, written in Matlab, is an annual simulation of an ejector driven cooling cycle, with an energy storage
system in between the solar field and the cooling cycle. There are also several different scripts that calculate the 
performance of the ejector and the cooling cycle overall, that they are needed for the actual simulation to run.
All of the scripts recquire COOLPROP and/or REFPROP (depending on the working fluid) in order to run.
