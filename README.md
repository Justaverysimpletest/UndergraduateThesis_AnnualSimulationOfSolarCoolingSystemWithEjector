Solar Cooling Annual Simulation (Matlab Code)
This code, written in Matlab, is an annual simulation of an ejector driven cooling cycle, with an energy storage
system in between the solar field and the cooling cycle. Uploaded files are:
1) The main window where annual simulation
takes places, 
2) A tridiagonial equation solver(TES Modeling script) which solves the equation that describe the modeling
of TESS (thermal energy storage system) splitting it to several zones between of whom energy and mass transfer 
phenomena take place. 
3) 2 scripts that model the several (but not all) heat exchangers of the system
There are also several different scripts that calculate the performance of the ejector and the cooling cycle overall, 
that they are needed for the actual simulation to run.
All of the scripts recquire COOLPROP and/or REFPROP (depending on the working fluid) in order to run.

Happy to share anything else needed
